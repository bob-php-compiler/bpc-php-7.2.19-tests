<?php

class Base {
	private function __destruct() {
    	echo __METHOD__ . "\n";
	}
}

class Derived extends Base {
}

$obj = new Derived;

unset($obj);

Warning: in %s line 4: Current implementation of class __destruct is very ugly!!! __destruct will never be called until program end!!! class objects memory will never be freed until program end!!!
